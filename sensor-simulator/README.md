## Project Title: 
Garbage Tracking IoT& Blockchain

## Description/Use Case:
This python scrypt is used to automate and simulate the output of IoT sensors that can be used to track the garbage smartly. it created a modular and hierarchical structure to create multiple json elements.
The end goal is to make the creation of sample data faster and costumizable. The number of json elements to be created and fed consequently to the blockchain can so be easily modified. 

##Business Case
Test the integration with the third party blockchain without having to deploy the IoT infrastructure. Use this scrypt to sobstitute the sensors to input data in the blockchain.

## Usage
Create sample data mimic the content of the blockchain.

## Installation

Here is the simple step on how to install and deploy the project:
1. python3 simulation.py
